              Paul Gustave Louis Christophe Doré (6 January 1832 - 23 January
              1883) was a French printmaker, illustrator, painter, comics
              artist, caricaturist, and sculptor. He is best known for his
              prolific output of wood-engravings illustrating classic
              literature, especially those for the Vulgate Bible and Dante's
              Divine Comedy. These achieved great international success, and he
              became renowned for printmaking, although his role was normally as
              the designer only; at the height of his career some 40
              block-cutters were employed to cut his drawings onto the wooden
              printing blocks, usually also signing the image. He created over
              10,000 illustrations, the most important of which were copied
              using an electrotype process using cylinder presses, allowing very
              large print runs to be published simultaneously in many countries.
